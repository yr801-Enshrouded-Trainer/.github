## 🎮 What Is the Enshrouded Trainer?

A trainer is a standalone software that hooks directly into your Enshrouded game session, giving you on-demand cheat functions via hotkeys. Unlike mod menus with fancy UI, trainers are fast, clean, and performance-friendly. Perfect for casual players, speedrunners, and solo grinders.

The Enshrouded trainer is made for **offline use**, meaning no bans, no flags, and zero worries about playing how you want.
